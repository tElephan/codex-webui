 * Shared error predicates for the threads module.
 *
 * The RPC client now preserves `error.code`/`error.data`, but app-server uses a
 * single JSON-RPC code (-32600) for every rejected request, so the code alone
 * cannot tell "this turn is in progress" from "this field is unknown". Codes
 * gate the predicates; message matching is what discriminates, and keeping it
 * here makes an upstream wording change a one-file fix.
 *
 * Patterns are kept narrow and mutually exclusive on purpose — an over-broad
 * one silently reclassifies errors depending on which predicate runs first.
